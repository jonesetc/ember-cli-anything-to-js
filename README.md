# ember-cli-anything-to-js
Ember CLI preprocessor add-on to embed any type of file into a valid JS module, exporting the original file's contents as a string.

This is a **work in progress**

## TODOs

- Add tests
    - Make sure this is compatible with Ember CLI 0.2.0+
- Document
- Potentially concentrate non-js files to a certain directory in app
